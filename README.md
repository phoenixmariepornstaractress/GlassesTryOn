# GlassesTryOn

I'm seeking skilled Python developers with expertise in OpenCV, NumPy, Pillow, and Dlib to contribute to and enhance the GlassesTryOn project. This application allows users to virtually try on glasses in real-time using facial landmark detection and image overlays. I am looking to add new features such as advanced face shape detection, additional accessory options, improved overlay accuracy, customizable filters, and more. If you're experienced with these libraries and interested in helping develop and expand the project, your contributions would be highly valued!
